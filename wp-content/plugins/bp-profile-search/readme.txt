Custom members search forms and results pages, and custom members directories for your BuddyPress site.

== Description ==

With BP Profile Search you can build custom Members search forms, and custom Members directories or search results pages.

You can search BuddyPress profile fields, the *users* and *usermeta* tables (including roles), and user taxonomies (including BP member types).

To build a search form, use the form settings, and select the form's search results page among the existing Members directories.

You can display a search form:

* in its Members directory, using the option *Add to Directory* in the form settings
* in a sidebar or widget area, using the widget *Profile Search*
* in a post or page, using the shortcode<br><code>[bps_form id='id of your form']</code>

To build a Members directory, use the shortcode <code>[bps_directory]</code>, see the [Custom Directories](http://dontdream.it/bp-profile-search/custom-directories/) tutorial.

A detailed documentation is available on the [BP Profile Search](http://www.dontdream.it/bp-profile-search/) page.

Requires at least BuddyPress 2.4 -- Tested up to BuddyPress 4.1.0

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 4.6 =
Security release, please update immediately!

= 4.3 =
Note: If you, or your theme, are using a modified 4.2.x template, you have to edit and update it to the current template structure before upgrading. If you haven't modified the built-in templates instead, you can upgrade safely.

= 4.1 =
Note: If you are upgrading from version 4.0.x, you have to update your existing forms adding your directory page selection. Go to *Users -> Profile Search*, *Edit* each form, select its *Form Action (Results Directory)* and *Update*.

= 4.0 =
Note: BP Profile Search version 4 is not compatible with version 3. When you first upgrade to version 4, you have to reconfigure your BP Profile Search forms and widgets, and modify any BP Profile Search shortcodes and *do_action* codes you are using.
In a multisite installation, the BP Profile Search settings page is in the individual Site Admin(s), and no longer in the Network Admin.
