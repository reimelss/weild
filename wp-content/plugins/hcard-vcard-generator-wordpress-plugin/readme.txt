Given a user ID or login, this plugin will generate appropriate microformat compatible hCard and downloadable vCard formats for users.

== Description ==

The hCard & vCard Generator plugin was created to solve one specific problem, generating microformats compatible hCards from WordPress users and companion vCards for downloading purposes.

The plugin also beefs up the user profile section with new fields for organisation, job title, phone, fax and mobile numbers as well as address.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php echo generate_card($userID, $cardType); ?>` in your templates where $userID is the user's ID and $cardType is either "hCard" or "vCard", or use the provided hCard vCard widget in the sidebar, or thirdly you can use shortcode to insert into posts/pages. See below:

For example to generate the hCard for admin use:
`<?php echo generate_card(1, 'hCard'); ?>`

To generate the vCard for admin use:
`<?php echo generate_card(1, 'vCard'); ?>`

Alternatively, as of version 1.2 you can display the widget via shortcode:
`[hcardvcard title="Testing Title" user="1" display_vcard=true display_hcard=true]`

All attributes for the shortcode are optional, the current author gets used if no user value is given.

There is also a Widget included for easy use in the sidebar.

You can use the login name for the user value with the shortcode or widget rather than the ID, but calling the generate function directly requires the User ID.
